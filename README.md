## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++ (depending on implementation)
- Any supported hardware (STM32)


## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Lane Detection

Utilizes computer vision techniques like Canny edge detection, Hough transforms, or color thresholding to identify lanes in real time.

### 2️⃣ Path Planning

Uses Pure Pursuit, PID, and other control algorithms to ensure the vehicle follows the best racing line.

### 3️⃣ Control & Execution

Dynamically adjusts steering and speed to stay within the lanes and optimize performance.
