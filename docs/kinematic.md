## **1️⃣ Problem Statement**

For a **delta drive vehicle** (differential drive at the front wheels, passive rear wheel), we need to:

- Convert from **net velocity \( S \)** and **steering angle \( \theta \)** to left/right wheel velocities.

- Convert from left/right wheel velocities back to **\( S, \theta \)**.



We assume:

- \( S \) = net vehicle speed (m/s)

- \( \theta \) = steering angle (radians)

- \( W \) = distance between the front wheels (m)

- \( R \) = radius of each wheel (m)

- \( R_T \) = instantaneous turning radius (m)

- \( V_L, V_R \) = left and right wheel linear velocities (m/s)

- \( \omega_L, \omega_R \) = left and right wheel angular velocities (rad/s)





## **2️⃣ Kinematic Model & Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR)**



The **instantaneous center of rotation (ICR)** defines how the vehicle moves based on its wheel speeds. The vehicle follows a circular path around this center.



For a differential drive, the **turning radius \( R_T \)** is given by:

\[ R_T = \frac{W}{2} \tan^{-1}(\theta) \]



This means:

- If \( \theta = 0 \), the vehicle moves straight, and \( R_T \to \infty \).

- If \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (\(\pi/2\) rad), the vehicle rotates **in place** with \( R_T = 0 \).



The left and right wheel speeds must satisfy the turning motion around the **ICR**:



\[ V_L = S \left( 1 - \frac{W}{2R_T} \right) \]



\[ V_R = S \left( 1 + \frac{W}{2R_T} \right) \]



Now, converting linear speed to angular velocity using \( \omega = \frac{V}{R} \):



\[ \omega_L = \frac{V_L}{R} = \frac{S}{R} \left( 1 - \frac{W}{2R_T} \right) \]



\[ \omega_R = \frac{V_R}{R} = \frac{S}{R} \left( 1 + \frac{W}{2R_T} \right) \]



This completes the forward conversion. ✅





## **3️⃣ Converting Back: Wheel Velocities to \( S, \theta \)**

To recover \( S \) and \( \theta \) from the wheel velocities:



1. **Compute Net Speed \( S \)**

\[ S = \frac{V_L + V_R}{2} \]

Substituting \( V_L = \omega_L R \) and \( V_R = \omega_R R \):



\[ S = \frac{R}{2} (\omega_L + \omega_R) \]



2. **Compute Turning Radius \( R_T \)**

\[ R_T = \frac{W}{2} \times \frac{V_L + V_R}{V_R - V_L} \]



3. **Compute Steering Angle \( \theta \)**

\[ \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{2 R_T}{W} \right) \]





## **4️⃣ Summary of Final Formulas**

### **Convert \( S, \theta \) → \( \omega_L, \omega_R \):**

\[ \omega_L = \frac{S}{R} \times \left(1 - \frac{W}{2R_T}\right) \]

\[ \omega_R = \frac{S}{R} \times \left(1 + \frac{W}{2R_T}\right) \]

where

\[ R_T = \frac{W}{2} \tan^{-1}(\theta) \]



### **Convert \( \omega_L, \omega_R \) → \( S, \theta \):**

\[ S = \frac{R}{2} (\omega_L + \omega_R) \]

\[ R_T = \frac{W}{2} \times \frac{V_L + V_R}{V_R - V_L} \]

\[ \theta = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{2 R_T}{W} \right) \]
